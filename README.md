# mischief
in case you ever wanted linux to be more inconvenient

---

this is basically a silly linux lua script that will do random mischievous (but not harmful) stuff on your computer, like renaming files, or randomly pausing your media playback

to set it up just download the script, place it somewhere, and either schedule it yourself or let it do it itself (enabled by default; requires running the script manually the first time)

to configure open the script, you can comment and uncomment strings to enable or disable those mischief events. you can also chose whether the script will schedule itself or not, and how frequently

if you have any ideas (and can figure out how the script works) feel free to add them!
